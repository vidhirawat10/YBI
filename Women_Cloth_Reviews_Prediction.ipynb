By analyzing the text of these reviews using a Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, the model aims to classify new reviews based on their sentiment, helping businesses understand customer opinions and improve their products and services."

            "           Cute top. agree with other reviewer that it is really nice in person. the colors are rich and the embroidery is beautiful. it is a very full swing top, but be aware that the sides are a few inches shorter than the front and back. this isn't evident in the photo shown. i usually wear a sm in retailer tops, and the small looks larger on me than how it fits on the model, in fullness and especially in the arms. it's still cute enough to keep, but i personally probably could have gone down a size.       0.00      0.00      0.00         1\n",

            "        Everyone has said it, so i'll just add my two cents - this is a great, soft, flattering top. i bought two, one in white and one in black, and i have never worn them without getting compliments. i sometimes wear them buttoned up, and sometimes completely unbuttoned to expose tanks or bathing suits. (i live in florida, and these tops make great beach cover ups). i am 5'7\" and over 160 but not busty, and the medium was swimming on me, but i think this particular shirt is supposed to be that way. su       0.00      0.00      0.00         1\n",

            "        I ordered a 6p in this dress so it wld fall above my knees & be slightly smaller than a regular 6. sometimes a regular size 4 works, sometimes a 6. typically a regular size 6 is big on me. i am 5'3\", 118#, 36c. just recd the 6p in the mail. the first thing i noticed is that it's s a knit fabric that looks & feels like polyester although says 'cotton' on the inside label. i think it wld be a bit warm in hot weather, but that is just my observation. the main problem is that it is too big on each s       0.00      0.00      0.00         1\n",

            "        Love these.they are a lovely gauzey cotton so they actually feel light. they do have volume however i don't believe they make you look bulkier though i suppose that depends on body type and how they are styled on top (i first wore with a form-fitting sleeveless chambray button down). that said, i sized down which meant the waistband was really too snug and so i sewed the button over to allow more room, which is why i gave them four stars. they have an elegant retro feel, versatile for spring and       0.00      0.00      0.00         1\n",

Finally, I checked how accurate the predictions were with the test data, made some adjustments, and re-trained the model to improve its accuracy."
